                    
              
                 At least 10 best pracices I followed in this project were as following:
             ______________________________________________________________________________



1.       using Firebase
______________________________________

I used firebase to store the user's signup and login information.
Real-Time-Updates: Firebase provides real time updates and reflect directly.

Scalable and Efficient :its scalable and increase in scalability do not effects the performance without any latency we can get the efficient results in firebase .

Simple: Its simplicity is often appreciable as it gets integrated very easily .



2.    Proper Folder Structure
______________________________________
 When we had to build a scalable application and for a large community as well as with idffernet technolgies integrations . in such case we should prefer to use  a proper structure of the folders . It is because:

 less complexity and confusion: Proper folder structures helps youto maintain the code easly together .like keeping the frontend folder and its subfolder in one file and keeping the backend folder in one part .


Composition and search optimization:when we create differnet files for ease in coding and keeping the integrations seperate but combining them by using imports it makes the usage easy and when we had to make any type of changes in the files we can easily find them without scrolling in a large file and finding that.


3. Different folder for images
__________________________________
In this project a folder named assets is there in src which contains all the images .By doing such practice 
it saved my time as i had to just import what i want and in which file.




4. styled-components of React
________________________________
I used styled-components . Using them decreases the time consumption for creating a diffenret file and then wtititng the css there . It is a must when we had to handle a large project.This helped me in the following ways:

1.Saved the time for typing the css and then importing.
2.Already applied css components was there .
3.i can modify those already applied css components.





5.   Mongo Db Atlas
__________________________
As we had to deploy so using a local database in the personal systems will not work .
 we have to use cloud database . So there i preffered mongo db atlas.





 6. Try-catch Block  and async-await usage:
 _____________________________________________
I used try-catch block and async -await for backend part.

Try-catch block was used for handling the database work foreeg handling any queriy like find and findByIdAndUpdate so that if there wxist any errors it donot blocks or hinders the entire working of the  server connection.


async-await is just like a synchronous code but its used for handlinh the asynchronous code .I use dit for  hitting the 
A.P.I.s endpoints  await had some conditions which will wait until the async part where the url was stored is hitted .
by this format the whole wrok gets easy and maintained.






7. Api fetching(No-manual creation)
___________________________________

Its always recommended to use a platform for fetching the api,s, rather then creating your own only if your work  can be completed by using the pre-ready api,s.

It made the work easy.
I just need to entact it inside the application through the urls and some basic coding practices
Every type of url for movies,movies by genres ,tv shows ,documentaries etc can be accessed through urls.




8.Environment varaibles and other constants
______________________________________________
I used environment-variables in the project 
This file is very mandatory because it keeps the essentials things secure. 
It helps in following ways:
security: Mongo db string  which contains the password and username ,Also  port number,APi keys and base urls wer stored here for security purpose.



9. Hosting Frotnend and Backend seperately
_______________________________________________
I hosted them seperatly It comes under good practive because:
Testing seprately: For testing the integration of both i used this way.Firstly i hosted backed and then pasting its link in frontend then going to live link and whie sa=tarting the appBy this way if error occurs somehwere , we can easily find out that where is the problem and if it is in frontend or backend.




10. Deployed through Cli not manually on vercel
_______________________________________________________
I deployed the frontend part after the backend was done on render through vercel .It helped me in following ways:
it helped me in following ways:
New experience: I have never done this before  so i learned a new way to deploy therough cli by adding vercel package.
